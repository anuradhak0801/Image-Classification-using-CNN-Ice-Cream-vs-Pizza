# Image-Classification-using-CNN-Ice-Cream-vs-Pizza

In the age of digital content and automation, businesses in the food industry often face challenges in accurately identifying food items from images. Manual classification is time-consuming and prone to errors, especially when managing large datasets for online ordering, inventory, or dietary analysis. This can lead to inefficient operations, incorrect labeling, and reduced customer satisfaction.

This project falls under the domains of **Computer Vision**, **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**, and **FoodTech**, and it benefits a wide range of stakeholders including **restaurants**, **food delivery platforms**, **AI-powered nutrition and diet apps**, and **retail inventory systems**.

The objective is to develop a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model that classifies images into two categories: **Ice Cream** and **Pizza**. The model is trained using a set of labeled images and enhanced through data augmentation techniques to improve accuracy and generalization. The goal is to enable fast, automated, and accurate image classification that supports various food-tech applications and enhances user experience.
